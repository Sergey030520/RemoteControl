# RemoteControl

A simple simulator of TV control using a remote control is implemented, presented in the form of a graphical interface with buttons.

The interface is a vertical window (in portrait orientation) with a size of 240x680 pixels. On the remote there are buttons for switching channels from 0 to 9, buttons for switching to the next and previous channels, buttons for increasing and decreasing the volume in increments of 10%, as well as a button for turning on the TV.

At the bottom of the remote there is a mini-display with the current status display: the currently selected channel and the current volume level as a percentage.
